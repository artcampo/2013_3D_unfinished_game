A class which given a (x,z) returns the height.

Composition of convex hulls 2d. Any point that
is inside a ch is influenced by the height of
that convex hull.

Each zone is thus two convex hulls, one marking
the end of the reach of that zone, and the other
marking the zone of constant height.

For the making of the world's frontier one zone
is used.

Other zones that need an height zone:
